# Learning the codebase
Take a look at the [design docs](docs/README.md).

# Proposing a change
If there's a feature you'd like to implement, please start a [discussion](https://github.com/akkoro/assemblylift/discussions) describing 
your proposal before moving forward with a PR. This helps ensure that changes stay in scope and work isn't duplicated. ðŸ™‚

Changes don't have to be limited to new features! Feel free to propose something if there is code you think could be 
refactored to be clearer, documentation you'd like to contribute, CI/CD enhancements, etc.
